# Screnshots

## Homepage

In the homepage there is a chart showing the last seven days and the expenses related to them. <br>
The current day is the first one on the right.
<br>
Through the 2 plus button you can enter a new transaction.
<br>
<br>

## Add Transaction

In the new transaction modal you can add a title, amound and the date you have bought a certain item.
<br>
Validation is missing and the error management is basic.
Probably the next projects will be more refined, if not I will start my own project trying to bring all the best practices I use daily during my job.

## Homepage With Transaction

After adding a transaction that's how the homepage will look.
<br>
The chart is well showing the change, considering the new transaction added.
<br>
It's possible to remvoe the transaction through the bin button.

## Landscape orientation
In landscape orientation the application displays a switch that allows the user to choose between the chart or the transaction list to improve the visibility given the reduced screen space.
